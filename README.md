### Hi there!

With over 20 years in the tech industry, I‚Äôve had the opportunity to serve as a CTO, Chief Architect, and Consultant. My passion for technology drives me to contribute to open source projects and share my insights through blogging. Being a three-time Microsoft MVP award winner is a testament to my dedication and expertise.

I‚Äôve worked with a diverse range of companies, from startups to large enterprises, helping them navigate their technological challenges. My experience in running a business has provided me with a unique perspective on the operational and strategic aspects of the tech world.

Coding for both work and fun üòéüõ†Ô∏èüöÄ
